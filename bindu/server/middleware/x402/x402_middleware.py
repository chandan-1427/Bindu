"""X402 Payment Middleware for Bindu (x402 SDK v2).

Pipeline on a protected request:

1. Parse the JSON-RPC body. Malformed body → 402. (Previously bare
   ``except Exception`` let the request through; CVE-shape "fails-open
   on body parse".)
2. Method check — only methods listed in ``app_settings.x402.protected_methods``
   demand payment.
3. ``X-PAYMENT`` header decoded and parsed via the SDK's
   ``parse_payment_payload`` (handles both v1 and v2 payloads).
4. Match the payload to one of the agent's payment requirements.
5. **Replay-prevention**: claim ``(network, asset, nonce)`` in the nonce
   store before paying for verification. Replays are rejected here, not
   after the facilitator round-trip.
6. **Verification**: ``x402ResourceServer.verify_payment`` delegates the
   EIP-3009 signature recovery and on-chain balance check to the
   configured facilitator. We trust ``result.is_valid``; on False we
   reject without falling through.

Compared with the v0.2.1 middleware this rewrite removes the manual
Web3 connection pool, the manual ``balanceOf`` call, the
silent fall-through when no contract code is found at the asset
address, and the unused signature-verification branch — all of those
responsibilities now live in the facilitator and are exercised by the
SDK's verify path.
