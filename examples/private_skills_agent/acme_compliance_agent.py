"""ACME Compliance — example of an agent with private skills.

This example exists to show the shape of the `private_skills` +
`allowed_dids` config. It does NOT call an LLM; the handler is a
deliberately boring echo so you can run it without any API key.

What the example demonstrates:

  GET /.well-known/agent.json    → "greet" and "status" only
                                   (the public catalog)
  GET /agent/private.json        → 401 without auth
                                   → 403 with auth but non-allowlisted DID
                                   → 200 with merged catalog when DID is
                                     on the allowlist (greet + status +
                                     cbam-line-classify + eudr-due-diligence)

Run it:

    $ uv run python examples/private_skills_agent/acme_compliance_agent.py

Then hit it with curl:

    $ curl -s http://localhost:3773/.well-known/agent.json | jq .skills

    $ curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\\n" http://localhost:3773/agent/private.json
    401

(For the 200 case you need a Hydra-issued bearer + DID signature; see
docs/AUTHENTICATION.md. The unit tests in
tests/unit/server/endpoints/test_private_agent_card.py cover the
authenticated branch with a stub middleware.)
