"""Joke Agent — port 5773.

Part of the gateway_test_fleet: five single-file agents deliberately
narrow in scope so the gateway's planner has to pick the right one for
each query. This one tells jokes.

Narrow instructions are intentional. We want the planner to fail cleanly
when asked to do something off-topic (e.g. "solve an equation") — not to
helpfully attempt the off-topic request and muddy the test signal.

Port: 5xxx range is reserved for agents (3xxx is infra — comms UI on
3775, comms-api on 3787, gateway on 3774). Fleet map: 5773 joke_agent,
5775 math, 5776 poet, 5777 research, 5778 bindu_docs.

Environment:
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY — required (examples/.env)
    BINDU_PORT         — optional override (default 5773)
