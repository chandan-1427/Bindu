# Bindu

**The identity, communication, and payments layer for AI agents.**

</div>

Bindu turns any AI agent into a production microservice. Write the agent in any framework — Agno, LangChain, OpenAI SDK, CrewAI, LangGraph, plain TypeScript — wrap it with one `bindufy()` call, and get an HTTP service with a cryptographic DID, the A2A protocol, OAuth2 auth, and on-chain payments. No infrastructure code. No rewriting.

Works from Python, TypeScript, and Kotlin. Built on three open protocols: [A2A](https://github.com/a2aproject/A2A), [AP2](https://github.com/google-agentic-commerce/AP2), and [x402](https://github.com/coinbase/x402).

## What you get

When you wrap an agent with `bindufy(config, handler)`, the process comes up with:

| Capability | What it means in practice |
|---|---|
| A2A JSON-RPC endpoint | Standard protocol other agents already speak. `message/send`, `tasks/get`, `message/stream` on port 3773. |
| DID identity (Ed25519) | Every returned artifact is signed. Callers verify authenticity with a W3C-standard DID — no shared secrets. |
| OAuth2 via Ory Hydra | Scoped tokens (`agent:read`, `agent:write`, `agent:execute`) instead of one all-or-nothing bearer. |
| x402 payments | One flag and the agent charges USDC on Base before processing a request. Payment check runs before the handler. |
| Push notifications | Webhook callbacks on task state change. No polling required. |
| Language-agnostic | Python, TypeScript, and Kotlin SDKs share one gRPC core. Same protocol, same DID, same auth. |
| Public tunnel | `expose: true` opens an FRP tunnel so your local agent is reachable from the public internet. |

---

## Install

```bash
uv add bindu
```

For a development checkout with tests:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/getbindu/Bindu.git
cd Bindu
uv sync --dev
```

Requires Python 3.12+ and [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv). An API key for at least one LLM provider (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or `MINIMAX_API_KEY`) is needed to run the examples.

---

## Hello agent

A complete working agent, built with Agno, exposed as an A2A microservice:

```python
import os
from bindu.penguin.bindufy import bindufy
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

agent = Agent(
    instructions="You are a research assistant that finds and summarizes information.",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
)

config = {
    "author": "you@example.com",
    "name": "research_agent",
    "description": "Research assistant with web search.",
    "deployment": {
        "url": os.getenv("BINDU_DEPLOYMENT_URL", "http://localhost:3773"),
        "expose": True,
    },
    "skills": ["skills/question-answering"],
}

def handler(messages: list[dict[str, str]]):
    return agent.run(input=messages)

bindufy(config, handler)
```

Run it, and your agent is live at the configured URL. Override the port without editing code with `BINDU_PORT=4000`.

<details>
<summary>TypeScript equivalent</summary>

```typescript
import { bindufy } from "@bindu/sdk";
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

bindufy({
  author: "you@example.com",
  name: "research_agent",
  description: "Research assistant.",
  deployment: { url: "http://localhost:3773", expose: true },
  skills: ["skills/question-answering"],
}, async (messages) => {
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4o",
    messages: messages.map(m => ({ role: m.role as "user" | "assistant" | "system", content: m.content })),
  });
  return response.choices[0].message.content || "";
});
```

The TypeScript SDK launches the Python core automatically. Same protocol, same DID. Full example in [`examples/typescript-openai-agent/`](examples/typescript-openai-agent/).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Calling the agent with curl</summary>

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3773/ \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "message/send",
    "id": "<uuid>",
    "params": {
      "message": {
        "role": "user",
        "kind": "message",
        "parts": [{"kind": "text", "text": "Hello"}],
        "messageId": "<uuid>",
        "contextId": "<uuid>",
        "taskId": "<uuid>"
      }
    }
  }'
```

Poll `tasks/get` with the same `taskId` until state is `completed`. The returned artifact carries a DID signature under `metadata["did.message.signature"]`.

</details>

## How it fits

```
your handler  ──►  bindufy(config, handler)
                          │
                          ▼
                 ┌────────────────────────────────────┐
                 │  Bindu core (HTTP :3773)           │
                 │    OAuth2 (Hydra)                  │
                 │    DID verification                │
                 │    x402 payment check (optional)   │
                 │    Task manager + scheduler        │
                 └────────────────────────────────────┘
                          │
                          ▼
                 A2A-signed artifact returned to caller
```

`bindufy()` is a thin wrapper. Your handler stays pure — `(messages) -> response`. Bindu owns identity, protocol, auth, payment, storage, and scheduling.

---

## Calling a secured agent

The `curl` example in *Hello agent* works because auth is off by default — anyone can POST to your agent. The moment you flip `AUTH__ENABLED=true AUTH__PROVIDER=hydra`, your agent gets stricter. Every caller now has to answer two questions before the handler runs:

1. **Are you allowed to call me?** — show a valid OAuth2 token from Hydra.
2. **Are you really who you say you are?** — sign the request with a DID key.

Think of it like boarding a flight: the boarding pass (OAuth token) says "yes, you have a seat on this flight," and the passport (DID signature) says "and you really are the person on that boarding pass." The server checks both.

The full theory lives in [`docs/AUTHENTICATION.md`](docs/AUTHENTICATION.md) and [`docs/DID.md`](docs/DID.md) — plain-English, no crypto background assumed. What follows is the practical "I just want to call my agent" version.

<br>

### The three extra headers

Alongside the usual `Authorization: Bearer <hydra-jwt>`, every secured request carries:

| Header | Value |
|---|---|
| `X-DID` | your DID string, e.g. `did:bindu:you_at_example_com:myagent:<uuid>` |
| `X-DID-Timestamp` | current unix seconds (server allows 5 min skew) |
| `X-DID-Signature` | `base58( Ed25519_sign( <signing payload> ) )` |

The **signing payload** is reconstructed on the server like this:

```python
json.dumps({"body": <raw-body-string>, "did": <did>, "timestamp": <ts>}, sort_keys=True)
```

Two gotchas that will bite you until you've felt them:

- **Match Python's JSON spacing.** Python's default `json.dumps` writes `", "` and `": "` (with spaces). `JSON.stringify` in JS writes them without. If your payload serializes differently, Ed25519 sees different bytes and the server returns `reason="crypto_mismatch"`.
- **Sign what you send.** If you parse the body, modify it, re-serialize, and ship that — you signed the wrong bytes. Build the body string **once**, sign those exact bytes, send those exact bytes.

<br>

### Step 1 — get a bearer token from Hydra

The agent prints a ready-to-run curl in its startup banner. The short version:

```bash
SECRET=$(jq -r '.[].client_secret' < .bindu/oauth_credentials.json)
curl -X POST https://hydra.getbindu.com/oauth2/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials" \
  -d "client_id=did:bindu:you_at_example_com:myagent:<uuid>" \
  -d "client_secret=$SECRET" \
  -d "scope=openid offline agent:read agent:write"
```

The response has an `access_token`. It's good for about an hour — cache it, refetch when you need it.

<br>

### Step 2 — pick your client

**Python — the shortest working example.** Reads the agent's own keys (Bindu writes them to `.bindu/` on first boot), signs a request, polls for the result. Self-call works because the agent's keys *are* a valid caller identity.

```python
import base58, httpx, json, time, uuid
from pathlib import Path
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization

# 1. Load the keys Bindu wrote on first boot
priv  = serialization.load_pem_private_key(Path(".bindu/private.pem").read_bytes(), password=None)
creds = next(iter(json.loads(Path(".bindu/oauth_credentials.json").read_text()).values()))
did   = creds["client_id"]            # DID doubles as the Hydra client_id

# 2. Exchange credentials for a short-lived JWT
bearer = httpx.post("https://hydra.getbindu.com/oauth2/token", data={
    "grant_type": "client_credentials",
    "client_id": creds["client_id"], "client_secret": creds["client_secret"],
    "scope": "openid offline agent:read agent:write",
}).json()["access_token"]

# 3. Build the body ONCE — these are the bytes we'll sign AND send
tid = str(uuid.uuid4())
body = json.dumps({
    "jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "message/send", "id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
    "params": {"message": {
        "role": "user", "kind": "message",
        "parts": [{"kind": "text", "text": "Hello!"}],
        "messageId": str(uuid.uuid4()), "contextId": str(uuid.uuid4()), "taskId": tid,
    }},
})

# 4. Sign: base58(Ed25519( json.dumps({body,did,timestamp}, sort_keys=True) ))
ts      = int(time.time())
payload = json.dumps({"body": body, "did": did, "timestamp": ts}, sort_keys=True)
sig     = base58.b58encode(priv.sign(payload.encode())).decode()

# 5. Fire it
r = httpx.post("http://localhost:3773/", content=body, headers={
    "Content-Type":    "application/json",
    "Authorization":   f"Bearer {bearer}",
    "X-DID":           did,
    "X-DID-Timestamp": str(ts),
    "X-DID-Signature": sig,
})
print(r.status_code, r.json())
```

For a full-featured version with polling and error handling, see [`examples/hermes_agent/call.py`](examples/hermes_agent/call.py).

<br>

**Postman — paste one script into your collection.**

1. Open your collection → **Pre-request Script** tab → paste the contents of [`docs/postman-did-signing.js`](docs/postman-did-signing.js).
2. Set two collection variables: `bindu_did` (your DID string) and `bindu_did_seed` (your 32-byte Ed25519 seed, base64-encoded).
3. Add an `Authorization: Bearer {{bindu_bearer}}` header and drop your Hydra token into `bindu_bearer`.
4. Hit Send. The script signs the exact body bytes Postman is about to send and sets the three `X-DID-*` headers for you.

Requires Postman Desktop v11+ (needs Ed25519 in `crypto.subtle`).

<br>

**Plain curl — technically possible, usually painful.** The signature depends on the body bytes you're about to send, so you need a helper script to compute the signature first, then substitute it into the curl call. If you're doing this, you're probably better off using the Python client above.

<br>

### When signatures fail

The server logs one of three reasons. If your request gets rejected with a 403, ask the operator (or check the server log yourself):

| Log says | What it means | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `timestamp_out_of_window` | Your `X-DID-Timestamp` is more than 5 min off the server's clock, or you reused an old timestamp | Recompute `int(time.time())` on every request |
| `malformed_input` | The base58 decoding of the signature or public key failed | Check the `X-DID-Signature` isn't URL-encoded, truncated, or wrapped in quotes |
| `crypto_mismatch` | The bytes you signed ≠ the bytes you sent | Rebuild the payload with `sort_keys=True` and Python's default JSON spacing; sign the raw body string once and send the same bytes |

One sharper failure mode we hit in testing: if `crypto_mismatch` persists and you're *sure* your bytes match, Hydra's stored public key for this DID may be stale from an older registration. Fix: stop the agent, delete `.bindu/oauth_credentials.json`, restart — Hydra's client record will be refreshed with the current keys.

---

## Gateway — multi-agent orchestration

A single `bindufy()`-wrapped agent is a microservice. The **Bindu Gateway** is a task-first orchestrator that sits on top: give it a user question and a catalog of A2A agents, and a planner LLM decomposes the work, calls the right agents over A2A, and streams results back as Server-Sent Events. No DAG engine, no separate orchestrator service — the planner's LLM picks tools per turn.

What you get beyond a single agent:

- **One endpoint: `POST /plan`** — hand it a question and an agent catalog, get streamed steps.
- **Agent catalog per request** — external systems pass the list of agents, skills, and endpoints. No fleet hosting in the gateway itself.
- **Session persistence (Supabase)** — Postgres-backed with compaction, revert, and multi-turn history.
- **Native TypeScript A2A** — no Python subprocess, no `@bindu/sdk` dependency in the gateway.
- **Optional DID signing + Hydra integration** — gateway identity end-to-end.

Minimal quickstart:

```bash
cd gateway
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local         # fill SUPABASE_*, GATEWAY_API_KEY, OPENROUTER_API_KEY
npm run dev                        # → http://localhost:3774
curl -sS http://localhost:3774/health
```

Apply the two Supabase migrations first (`gateway/migrations/001_init.sql`, `002_compaction_revert.sql`). Full walkthrough and operator reference live in [`gateway/README.md`](gateway/README.md) and [`docs/GATEWAY.md`](docs/GATEWAY.md) (45-minute end-to-end: clean clone → three chained agents → authoring a recipe → DID signing).

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>Common issues</summary>

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| `uv: command not found` | Restart your shell after installing uv. |
| `Python version not supported` | Install Python 3.12+ from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or via `pyenv`. |
| `bindu: command not found` | Activate your virtualenv: `source .venv/bin/activate`. |
| `Port 3773 already in use` | Set `BINDU_PORT=4000`, or override with `BINDU_DEPLOYMENT_URL=http://localhost:4000`. |
| `ModuleNotFoundError` | Run `uv sync --dev`. |
| Pre-commit fails | Run `pre-commit run --all-files`. |
| `Permission denied` (macOS) | `xattr -cr .` to clear extended attributes. |

Reset the environment:

```bash
rm -rf .venv && uv venv --python 3.12.9 && uv sync --dev
